My solutions for ["Advent of Code"](http://adventofcode.com/).

Written in Python 3, since it had been a while since I had written something in it. Some solutions were inspired by solutions by others found on Reddit, and the solution for day 22 was a copy, as I found that task uninteresting and time-consuming.

This repo is an afterthought, as I initially did not think of solving all problems, just ment to try a few.
